\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Teko VietNam}{July 2017 - July 2021}{Software Engineering}{Ha Noi, Viet Nam}
\item My responsibility was to develop an e-commerce website \textbf{Tekshop.vn} by customizing and developing Magento module, which now becomes \textbf{Phongvu.vn}
\item One year after, our team decided to commit a huge improvement by creating \textbf{Phongvu.vn} client side by VueJS framework
\item After diving into \textbf{Phongvu.vn} development for nearly two years, my responsibility was to revive \textbf{Vnshop.vn}, which was obsolete by technology but was currently embedding into almost VietNamese Mobile Banking Application. Not only by the client-side, but I am also in charge of creating a backend that serves as a data source from the fulfillment system and payment integration.
\item To pursuit the modern Web Development technology and solve the trade-off between SEO and Client-side rendering, my team decided to make a major migration for \textbf{Phongvu.vn} and \textbf{Vnshop.vn} client side. We created an ultimate version by NextJS. Soon, I was involved in extending our system into an e-commerce website platform to many partners: \textbf{Vinmart.com}, \textbf{Karavan.vn}, \textbf{Umbala.vn}, \textbf{Shop.meatdeli.com.vn} etc.
